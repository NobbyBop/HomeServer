  "description": "These are some of my favorite sketches I've done on over the past few years (starting circa 2022). Most are done in ballpoint pen, although some use other kinds of ink pens. This sketchbook has been a primary emotional outlet for me for the past few years, and these pieces articulate the sense of style I've developed over that time.",
