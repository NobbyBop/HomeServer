    "description": "WORLDLY is a zine I worked on at the end of 2023. It was a time I felt that I had been consumed with worries of career and social status. I noticed my own departure from philisophical and spiritual contemplation, and wanted to express the shallowness of materialism and commercialism. This was my (somewhat successful) attempt to reshift my focus to things that really matter.",
